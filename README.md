# P2P-File-transfer
A cross-platform file transfer application for desktop and mobile built with Flutter, enabling seamless file sharing, QR code pairing, messaging, and offline transfers via Wi-Fi or hotspots for enhanced collaboration and productivity.

This project focuses on developing a cross-platform file transfer application that allows users to share files such as documents, photos, and videos seamlessly across mobile devices, desktops, and web platforms. Built using Flutter, the application ensures a consistent and responsive user experience across all platforms. Features like QR code scanning for device pairing, messaging capabilities, and collaborative tools will enhance usability, making file sharing and teamwork more efficient.

Technical Stack and Features

Flutter for Cross-Platform Development
Flutter serves as the core framework, enabling the creation of a single codebase that supports Android, iOS, and web platforms. Its rich widget library and high-performance rendering engine ensure a visually appealing and intuitive user interface. This approach simplifies development while maintaining a consistent user experience across devices.

SQLite for Local Data Management
SQLite will be used to manage local data, such as file metadata and user preferences. Its lightweight, serverless architecture is ideal for mobile applications, ensuring fast and efficient data retrieval and organization.

Dual Protocols for File Transfers (UDP and TCP)

UDP: Used for fast file transfers in local networks, particularly for large files like videos, due to its low latency.

TCP: Ensures reliable data transmission for smaller or sensitive files, preventing data loss or corruption.
This dual-protocol approach allows the application to adapt to varying network conditions and user needs.

QR Code Scanning for Device Pairing
The application will include a QR code scanning feature to simplify device connections. Users can scan a QR code generated by the desktop application to establish a connection, eliminating the need for manual input of connection details. This feature enhances convenience and reduces setup time.

Hotspot and Wi-Fi File Transfers
File sharing will be supported over both Wi-Fi and mobile hotspots, enabling users to transfer files without relying on internet connectivity. This flexibility ensures usability in diverse environments, whether connected to a local network or using a mobile hotspot.

Messaging and Collaboration Tools
Beyond file sharing, the application will integrate messaging features to enable real-time communication and collaboration. Users can discuss shared files and work together more effectively, making the application a comprehensive tool for productivity and teamwork.
